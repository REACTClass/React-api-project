This is a class project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and REACT.

For this project I have decided to make an image gallery using Pixabay API.

Users can search for images using the integrated search bar.

The website is designed using pure CSS including stying the scrollbar.

There's a toggle button in the header next to the links to change between light mode and dark mode.

Take a look: <a href= "https://fanciful-cassata-4894ad.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Search Images</a>
